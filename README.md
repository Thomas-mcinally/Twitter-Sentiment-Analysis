# Wordle
I analysed all the tweets from UK users mentioning 'Wordle', from 01/12/2021 to 15/03/2022

The analysis used a BERT model trained on twitter data (https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment)

Going into it, I was anticipating seeing a shift in sentiment when wordle was acquired by NY Times (31. Jan 2022). This turned out to be False.
